# My minimal Neovim
*based on [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)* 

When I started my Neovim journey, I hacked things together with kickstart and created a mess.
It didn't matter when I tried refactoring with kickstart-modular, I had no clue what I was doing.

> *Maybe I should have learned Lua like a real man, things could have been different.*

When I tried AstroNvim, the structure, ease-of-use, and overall feel was what I needed - 
until it wasn't. It was tedious mangling with abstraction any time I wanted to change something.

> *I read more documentation for AstroNvim than for the plugin I wanted to install...*

When I set up a Debian 12 VM, I didn't need all the juice AstroNvim provided so I put this
minimal nvim configuration together with kickstart-modular again.

> *And my god, this is clean - I did most of it myself and things finally make sense*
