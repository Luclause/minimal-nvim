# My Neovim Configuration
*based on [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)* 

You could say my configuration is kinda messy - that's because it is. 
Some plugins fit in nicely while other more complex ones I seem to wrestle 
with its integration with AstroNvim.

> You're free to clone this, rip it apart, and transform it as your own :)

## Prequisites

- A Nerd Font ([JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/JetBrainsMono.zip))

## 🛠️ Installation

#### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder

1. Clone this repository into a separate directory
2. Copy contents of my `dotfiles/.config/nvim` into your `$HOME/.config/nvim` as desired

> Alternatively, `git sparse-checkout` is an option if you'd like to stay updated with my config
